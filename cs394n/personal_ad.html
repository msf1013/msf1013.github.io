	Hi, my name is Mario and I am a master’s student
	in the CS department. I am not really pursuing a
	research career but some of my interests include
	computer graphics and distributed systems. Most
	of my experience relates to practical software
	engineering in systems and applications development.
</p>

<p>
	I have some little experience in general ML as I 
	took CS391L. Among my “hidden” talents I would mention
	some computer graphics background and (unrelated to 
	the field) playing soccer.
</p>

<p>
	Potential topics that I am considering for the project,
	in order of preference:
</p>

<p>(1) Artistic style transfer (top) </p>

<p>(2) Time series prediction</p>

<p>(3) Image recognition</p>

<p>Contact: mario.sergio@utexas.edu</p>

<p>I have not yet teamed up with anyone.</p>
